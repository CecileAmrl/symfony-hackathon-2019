# Doctrine Project achievements

We managed to automate the release and maintenance process for most of
the projects under [Doctrine organisation](https://github.com/doctrine/).

The result of our design and implementation is currently available for
public review in the [`doctrine/automatic-releases`](https://github.com/doctrine/automatic-releases)
repository.

Thanks to this development, we will (over the next few weeks) be able to:

- merge multiple dozen pull requests that have been pending due to
  current maintenance availability restrictions
- automatically prepare releases for those merges
- automatically port these patches into newer versions of `doctrine/*`
  libraries.

In addition to that, we will reduce the learning curve needed for new
maintainers to join the project.
