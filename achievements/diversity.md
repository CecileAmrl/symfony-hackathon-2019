## Diversity
During the hackathon we aimed to make use of being able to easily dicuss several topics that would prove difficult over chat. A few big topics we picked revolve primarily around SymfonyCon and the community. 

### SymfonyCon Social
One of the big topics to work on, is the SymfonyCon social. Our aim is to make it easily accessible with a diverse set of activities to cater different groups and preferences. Think about a music room where you can dance versus a board game room where people can have a more quiet interaction with each other. We also try to come up with ideas to ensure enough seating is available, non-alcoholic drinks are the primary focus and people don't want to or have to leave early.

### Conference Improvements
When working on improvements, there are bigger and smaller issues to solve. We have been classifying and refining points to work on ranging from both physical and digital accessability, to things like food allergies, scents and fragrance, and [various conference comfort points](https://github.com/symfony/diversity/issues/78). We plan on adding a keynote or lightning talk to the opening of the conference in Amsterdam, to give an explanation and goal of this initiative, and a presentation to invite people to become a speaker.

Another point we want to try and improve, is the social experience _during_ the conference; namely between the talks, instead of just the social event. By introducing a system based on [DockerPals](https://europe-2018.dockercon.com/docker-pals/), we hope to give 'pals' an experience that goes beyond the technical aspect of a conference.
