With over 50 participants, the first [EU FOSSA](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eu-fossa-2/about) [hackathon](https://eufossahackathon.bemyapp.com/) focused on PHP [Symfony](https://symfony.com) and [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/).
It took place in Brussels on 6 and 7 April 2019.

During the hackathon, some of the most active developers from the PHP Symfony community got together, many for the first time. The purpose of the hackathon was to bring together developers from outside and within the European Commission. Their time together was spent working on important issues for the community and the EU institutions such as new features and security.
