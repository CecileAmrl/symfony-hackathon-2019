# Symfony Console

In Symfony Console we've fixed some bugs that were blocking some contributor to run the tests and to contribute even more to the component.

We started talking about how we could refactor the SymfonyStyle and blocks in
order to have something more usable and maintenable. The fact that core team
members and contributors meet helped a lot to fix some of the bugs.
