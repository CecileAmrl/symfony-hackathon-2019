## Diversity
During the hackathon we aimed to make the most of being able to easily discuss
several topics that would prove difficult over chat. A few big topics we picked
revolve primarily around SymfonyCon and the community. 

### SymfonyCon Social
One of the big topics to work on is the social evening of the next SymfonyCon.
Our aim is to improve accessibility with a diverse set of activities to cater
different groups and preferences. Think about a music room where you can dance
versus a board game room where people can have a more quiet interaction with
each other. We also try to come up with ideas to ensure enough seating is
available, non-alcoholic drinks are the primary focus and people don't want
to or have to leave early.

### Conference Improvements
When working on improving the conferences, there are bigger and smaller issues
to solve. We have been classifying and refining points to work on ranging
from both physical and digital accessibility to things like food allergies,
scents and fragrance, and [various conference comfort points][1]. We aim
to add a keynote or lightning talk to the opening of the conference in Amsterdam,
to give an explanation and goal of this initiative, and a presentation to
invite people to become a speaker.

Another point we want to try and improve, is the social experience _during_
the conference; namely between the talks. By introducing a system based on
[DockerPals][2], we hope to give 'pals' an experience that goes beyond the
technical aspect of a conference.
